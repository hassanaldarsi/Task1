# Task1
The motor used in the robotic arm and it is more suited for this kind of mission is LD-260MG. So here below I will mention the reason why I used this type of motor instead of MG9950 motor:

-The  LD-260MG motor allows the robotic elbow to rotate 180 degrees like a human elbow which swings 180 degrees, invert of MG9950 motor which allows the robotic elbow to rotate only 120 degrees.
